# odin-recipes
A website containing some of my go-to recipes.

This is the first website I have built for the Odin Project.

In this project, I demonstrate the following skills:
- Create a repository in GitHub and link it to my local machine.
- Create different pages for a website using HTML.
- Link those pages together using relative links.
- Use different headers and fonts within the pages.
